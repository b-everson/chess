chess game classes


board

chesspiece, each player has 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 1 queen, 1 king, 8 pawns
rooks can move only in a straigt line, knights can move down 3 and over 1 or down 1 and over 3, queens can move diag or straight
king can move 1 square

chesspiece functions & attributes
  position - x & y
  character for representation (K,q,k,b,r,p)
  move 
  available move ---anticipated result of available moves needed for ai player i.e. available moves after available move
  value - king highest, queen high, rook med, knight med, bishop med, pawn low

compPlayer- controls chesspiece objects on one side 


game-- loop until game is over, alternating turns
  draw board after each players turn


 



------misc ideas

piece isVulnerable()
check each peice of comp players 
to see if a player's piece can remove that piece

if no pieces vulnerable, move pieces into position to take enemy pieces, if pawn blocks other pieces move to create hole



problem- position can be vulnerable to multiple pieces at one time

if all vulnerable pieces can be protected, do that- i.e if any piece can remove enemy piece that creates vulnerability 
& block another piece from high value piece, use that piece


for each comp piece
  if(position vulnerable)
    if(!list.contains aggressive piece)
      add aggressive piece to list



-------design issue 
I want the pieces to be able to "see" the available moves, which means 
there needs to be a reference to the board positions & whether or not they
are blocked. 


----another issue, characters are all white, no way to differentiate player's pieces
temp solution - signify with (p1) or (p2)


--movement different for each side, need computer player to move pieces downward









game owns a board and two players
player owns pieces

to check available moves for a piece, it must be aware of the board - pass board to player to piece?


piece has boardposition, boardposition has piece?
