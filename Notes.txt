misc ideas

piece isVulnerable()
check each peice of comp players 
to see if a player's piece can remove that piece

if no pieces vulnerable, move pieces into position to take enemy pieces, if pawn blocks other pieces move to create hole



problem- position can be vulnerable to multiple pieces at one time

if all vulnerable pieces can be protected, do that- i.e if any piece can remove enemy piece that creates vulnerability 
& block another piece from high value piece, use that piece


for each comp piece
  if(position vulnerable)
    if(!list.contains aggressive piece)
      add aggressive piece to list
